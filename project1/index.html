            When I was offered acceptance into the Honors College at the University of Maryland, I chose to pursue my Honors citation <br>
            within the University Honors program, as I felt it was most well-suited to my academic interests. <br> <br>

            Within the University Honors program, I have completed a 15-credit curriculum consisting of insightful seminars and thematic <br>
            clusters concerned with a single topic of contemporary and enduring significance to earn my citation. Some of these courses <br>
            include Identity, Places, and Spaces: The Study of Intersectionality, The Study of Masculinity in Society, Arbitrating Our Bodily <br>
            Rights: What it Means to Consent, and Body Boundaries: The Science Behind Asexuality, Coloniality, and Immortality.<br><br>
